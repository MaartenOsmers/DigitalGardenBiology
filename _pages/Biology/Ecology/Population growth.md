# Population growth
Population growth refers to change in the size of a [[population]], which can be either positive or negative over time.

[[Birth rate]]:
- Number of births of a species over a given period of time. 

[[Mortality rate]]:
- Number of deaths of a species over a given period of time. 

[[Growth rate]]: 
- Growth rate = birth rate - mortality rate. 

[[Population size]]: 
- Number of individuals in the population.

[[Population density]]:
- Quantity of individuals of a population per unit of space. 

[[Limiting factors]]:
- Are limiting the population size and density. Limiting factors are [[biotic factors]] and [[abiotic factors]]. 

[[Density-independent limiting factors]]: Independent on the population density like [[climactic factors]]. 


[[Density-dependent limiting factors]]: dependent on the population density for example [[intraspecific competition]] for food and territory (between individuals of the same specif, hence intraspecific competition). Also the frequency of contagious diseases as well as the amount of [[predators]] that feed on given population is dependent on the population density. --> The denser the population the more predators seek it as [[prey]]. 

[[Exponential growth]]: 
- When the absolute number of [[offspring]] per period of time increases with [[population size]].(Only a theoretical concept does not apply in reality)

[[Logistic growth]]: 
- When resources are limited, populations exhibit logistic growth. In logistic growth, population expansion decreases as [[resources]] become scarce, leveling off when the [[carrying capacity of the environment]] is reached.

## Negative feedback in population growth
1. The larger a population is the lower the number of resources available. The lower the number of resources available the lower the birth rate. The lower the birthrate the smaller the population and its growth. 

2. The smaller the population the larger the number of resources available. The larger the number of resources available the higher the birthrate. The higher the birthrate the higher the population and its growth. 

### Competition 
In biology, competition refers to the rivalry between or among living things for [[territory]], [[resources]], [[goods]], [[mates]], etc.

I[[ntraspecific competition]]: 
- Competition within or among the same members of the same species. 

[[Interspecific competition]]: 
- Competition between the members of different [[species]]. 

[[Competitive exclusion]]: 
- Result of a competition in which species are forced out entirely or out of parts of their available [[habitat]], by a more efficient species.

[[Competitive exclusion principle]]: 
- The competitive exclusion principle, states that two species that compete for the exact same resources cannot stably [[coexist]]. 
	- Coexistence can occur if intraspecific competition is stronger then interspecific competition meaning that each species will inhibit their own population. 

#### Ecological niche
The [[ecological niche]] describes the functional position of an organism in its environment. It also considers habitat, activity patterns and its resources. 

[[Fundamental niche]]: 


[[Realised niche]]:
