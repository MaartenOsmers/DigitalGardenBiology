# Energy flow in an ecosystem
[[Energy flow]] is the flow of [energy] through living things within an [[ecosystem]]. 

[[Gross primary production]] ([[GPP]]): 
- The total amount of [[organic material]] produced by [[primary producers]] ([[plants]]) (including that lost to [[respiration]])

[[Net primary production]] ([[NPP]]) :
- The amount of [[biomass]] that is available to [[consumers]] at each subsequent [[trophic level]]. (NPP= GPP - respiratory loses)

[[Secondary production]]: 
Secondary production represents the formation of living [[mass]] of a [[heterotrophic]] [[population]] or group of populations over some period of time.
