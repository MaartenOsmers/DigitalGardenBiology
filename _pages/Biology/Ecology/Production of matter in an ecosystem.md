# Production of matter in an ecosystem 

Autotroph: 
An [[autotroph]] or [[primary producer]] is an [[organism]] that produces complex organic compounds (such as [[carbohydrates]], [[fats]], and [[proteins]]) using [[carbon]] from simple substances such as [[carbon dioxide]]. [[Plants]] or [[algae]] are autotrophs. 

Heterotroph: 
A [[heterotroph]] is an [[organism]] that cannot produce its own food, instead taking [[nutrition]] from other sources of organic [[carbon]], mainly [[plant]] or [[animal]] matter. In the [[food chain]], heterotrophs are primary, secondary and tertiary consumers, but not [[producers]].

Material cycle: 
- [[Material cycles]] describe the flow of matter from the nonliving to the living world and back again. As this happens, [[matter]] can be stored, transformed into different molecules, transferred from [[organism]] to organism, and returned to its initial configuration.
- The carbon cycle: The first material cycle described in the video is the [[carbon cycle]], which is also a cycle for [[oxygen]]. The carbon cycle involves two chemical reactions that are also important in [[energy flow]]: [[photosynthesis]] and [[cell respiration]]. One reaction is the reverse of the other in terms of matter. Carbon enters the living world as [[carbon dioxide]] gas, which is “fixed” into [[sugar]] molecules. Carbon is recycled to the nonliving world as carbon dioxide gas; oxygen is recycled as oxygen gas. Oxygen from oxygen gas is never “fixed” in the way carbon is. It is used to “burn” sugar for [[energy]].

[[Dissimilation]]: 
- [[Degradation]] of organic substances with release of energy by cell respiration or [[fermentation]]. 

[[Phototrophic assimilation]]: 
- Conversion of foreign [[inorganic substances]] into [[endogenous organic substances]] mainly by photosynthesis. 
	- ([[Endogenous substances and processes]] are those that originate from within a system such as an organism, [[tissue]], or [[cell]].)

[[Heterothrophic assimilation]]:
- Conversion of foreign [[organic substances]] to endogenous organic substances by partial degradation of [[organic matter]] (dissimilation). 

- Endogenous organic matter = [[biomass]]
