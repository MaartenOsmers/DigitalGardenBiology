# Food chain / Food web
Food chain:
- A [[Food chain]] is a linear network of links in a [[food web]] starting from [[producer]] [[organisms]] and ending at an [[apex predator]] [[species]], [[detritivores]], or [[decomposer]] species. A food chain also shows how organisms are related to each other by the food they eat. Each level of a food chain represents a different [[Trophic level]].

Food web: 
- A f[ood web] is the natural interconnection of food chains and a graphical representation of what-eats-what in an ecological [[community]].
