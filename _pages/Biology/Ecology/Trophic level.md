# Trophic level
The trophic level is the position in a [[food chain]].

1. Trophic level: [[primary producers]] ([[plants]] and [[algae]]), ([[autotroph]])
2. Trophic level: [[primary consumers]] ([[animals]])
3. Trophic level: [[secondary consumers]] (animals), (intermediate [[predators]]) 
4. Trophic level: [[tertiary consumers]] (animals), ([[apex predators]])

## Ecological efficiency 
- [[Biomass]] production is reduced to 1/10 of the prior level with each subsequent trophic level.  Also called [[trophic efficiency]].
