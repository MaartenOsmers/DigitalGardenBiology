# Enviromental factors
An [[Environmental factor]], ecological factor or eco factor is any, [[abiotic factor]] or [[biotic factor]], that influences living [[organisms]]. It can either benefit or harm an organism. 

Abiotic enviromental factors: 
- Physical or chemical in nature ([[light]], [[temperature]], [[salinity]], [[humidity]])

Biotic enviromental factors:
- Biological in nature (other [[living organisms]] such as [[predators]], [[competitors]] or [[prey]])

[[Ecological potency]] / [[Ecological tolerance]]: 
- The ecological potency/tolerance indicates in which range of values of environmental factors a species can thrive or survive in over a long period of time. 
	- Eurypotent: Eurypotent organisms are able to tolerate strong fluctuations in [[environmental factors]] such as [[temperature]], [[salinity]], [[pressure]], [[humidity]], [[radiation]] etc. 
	- Stenopotent: Stenopotent organism tolerate only minor fluctuations of an environmental factor. 

[[Tolerance curve]]: 
- [[Maximum]]: The maximum denotes the area where a life is just possible. [[Growth]] and [[reproduction]] are impaired or no longer possible.
- [[Minimum]]: The minimum indicates the area where a life is just possible. Growth and reproduction are impaired or no longer possible.
- [[Optimum]]: In the optimum of existence, living beings living there find the best [[conditions]]. Growth and reproduction reach their absolute highest value here.
- [[Pessimum]]: The pessimum refers to the limit value of a tolerance range of a biological species within which the respective organism can just still exist. The opposite of this is the optimum.
- [[Preference area]]: The preference is the area where all vital functions of an organism are perfectly intact. In which growth and long term survival is possible in this area.
