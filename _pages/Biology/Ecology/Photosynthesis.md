# Photosynthesis 
Photosynthesis is the process by which [[plants]] use sunlight ([[light]]) [[water]], and [[carbon dioxide]] to create [[oxygen]] and [[energy]] in the form of sugar.

Equation: 
- 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O --sunlight + [[cholorophyll]]--> 6O<sub>2</sub> + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>

Process: 
- Photosynthetic [[electron transport chain]] needs 12 water molecules and makes 6 oxygen molecules out of them.
- [[Calvin cycle]] needs 12 energy rich electrons by [[NADH]] or [[FADH2]],  a variable number of [[ATP]] molecules and 6 carbon dioxide molecules. And it produces 6 water molecules and one molecule of [[glucose]].
