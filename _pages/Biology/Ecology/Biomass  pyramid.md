# Biomass pyramid
A [[Biomass]] pyramid shows the flow of [[energy]] between various trophic levels ([[Trophic level]]) . [[Producers]] and [[Consumers]] make up the biomass pyramid, which displays all their comparative masses at the same time. To create the biomass pyramid, the approximate masses are stacked up according to a well-established hierarchy.

## Different kinds of biomass pyramids 
1. [[Biomass production pyramids]]: are similar to [[biomass pyramids]] with the difference that they illustrate [[biomass production]] over time. 
2. [[Number pyramids]]: Count the number of each individual in a trophic level. Number pyramids are sometimes inverted when the is for example a large tree. 
3. [[Energy pyramids]]: are similar to biomass pyramids since (dry) biomass tend to have similar energy contents.
