# Receptor potential
A [[Receptor potential]] a type of graded potential, is the transmembrane potential difference produced by activation of a sensory receptor. A physical stimulus ([[Stimuli]]) acts on a sensory receptor.  That mechanical, chemical or light energy which acted as a stimulus is transformed into an electrical response this process is called sensory transduction. It is generally a depolarizing event resulting from inward current flow. The influx of current will often bring the membrane potential of the sensory receptor towards the threshold for triggering an [[Action potential]]. Receptor potential can work to trigger an action potential either within the same neuron ([[Neurons]]) or on an adjacent cell. 

## Different kinds of receptors
- Photorecptor 
- Chemorecptor
- Mechanoreceptor
- Thermoreceptor
- Electroreceptor
