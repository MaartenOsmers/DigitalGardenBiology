# Neurons
**Neurons** or also called nerve cells are the **fundamental units of the brain** and [[Nervous system]], the cells responsible **for receiving Sensory input from the external world, for sending Motor commands to our muscles, and for transforming and relaying the Electrical signals ([[Action potential]]) at every step in between**. More than that, their interactions define **who we are as people**.
