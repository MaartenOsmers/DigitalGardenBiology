# Axon  hillock
Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock also has **the greatest density of [[Voltage-gated sodium channels]]**. This makes it the **most easily excited part of the neuron** and **the spike initiation zone for the axon**. In electrophysiological terms, **it has the most negative [[threshold potential]]**.
