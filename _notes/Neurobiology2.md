# What is Neurobiology
Neurobiology is the scientific study of the [[Nervous system]] to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of [[Neurons]], glia, and [[Neural circuits]]. 


# Action potential
**An Action potential is a rapid rise and subsequent fall in voltage or membrane potential across a cellular membrane with a characteristic pattern**. **Sufficient current is required to initiate a voltage response in a cell membrane by passing the threshold**; if the current is insufficient to depolarize the membrane to the threshold level, **an action potential will not fire**. Examples of cells that signal via action potentials are **neurons and muscle cells**. -   Action potentials are caused **by [[Stimuli]] which are sufficient enough to pass the [[Threshold potential]] value of -50 to -55 mV**. It is important to know that the action potential behaves upon the **all-or-none law**. An **action potential propagates along the nerve fiber** **without decreasing or weakening of amplitude and length**. In addition, **after one action potential is generated, [[Neurons]] become refractory to stimuli for a certain period of time in which they cannot generate another Action potential**.

##  Steps of an action potential
An action potential has **four phases**: [[Resting potential]] **,[[Depolarization]]**, **[[Overshoot]]**, **[[Repolarization]]**. There is one more states of the membrane potential related to the action potential.**[[Hyperpolarization]]**, follows the **--> repolarization** and makes it more negatively charged It inhibits action potentials by increasing the stimulus required to move the membrane potential to the action potential threshold.  .

- The Resting potential is the initial state of an action potential (-70 mV)
- When an [[excitatory stimulus]] depolarizes the axon past its threshold (-55 mV), nearby [[Na+]] ion channels are opened. These channels are [[voltage-gated channels]]. A great Number of Na<sup>+</sup> ions enter the inside of the axon. This change in membrane potential leads to the opening of further [[voltage-gated sodium channels]] and [[Depolarization]] until the maximum for the action potential is reached (+35 mV). This phase of extreme positivity is the [[Overshoot]] phase. The individual Na<sup>+</sup> ion channels close fast and cannot be opened again for a short period of time until returning back to the resting potential. This process is called the [[refractory period]]. 
- The overshoot value **opens [[voltage-gated potassium channels]], which causes a large potassium efflux, decreasing the cell’s electropositivity**. This phase is the **repolarization** phase, whose purpose is to **restore the resting potential**. Repolarization always leads first to **hyperpolarization**.

### Refractory period
The refractory period **is the time after an [[Action potential]] is generated, during which the excitable cell cannot produce another action potential**. There are two subphases of this period, **absolute** and **relative refractoriness**.

#### Propagation of action potential
**An action potential is generated in the body of the neuron and propagated through its axon**. Propagation doesn’t decrease or affect the quality of the action potential in any way, so that the target tissue gets the **same impulse no matter how far they are from neuronal body**.

The action potential generates at one spot of the cell membrane. **It propagates along the membrane** with every next part of the membrane being sequentially depolarized. **This means that the action potential doesn’t move but rather causes a new action potential of the adjacent segment of the neuronal membrane**.

Action potential always propagates **forward**, **never backwards**. This is due to the refractoriness of the parts of the membrane **that were already depolarized**, **so that the only possible direction of propagation is forward**. Because of this, an action potential always propagates from the neuronal body, through the axon to the target tissue.

The speed of propagation largely depends on the thickness of the [[Axon]] and whether it’s myelinated or not. The larger the diameter, the higher the speed of propagation. The propagation is also faster if an axon is myelinated. Myelin ([[Myelin sheath]]) increases the propagation speed because it increases the thickness of the fiber. In addition, myelin enables [[Saltatory conduction]] of the action potential, since only the Ranvier nodes ([[Node of Ranvier]]) depolarize, and myelin nodes are jumped over.   
In unmyelinated fibers, every part of the axonal membrane needs to undergo [[Depolarization]], making the propagation significantly slower.


# ADP 
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP), is an important organic compound in [[metabolism]] and is essential to the flow of [[energy]] in living cells. ... Energy transfer used by all living things is a result of dephosphorylation of [[ATP]] by enzymes known as ATPases.

# ATP
Adenosine triphosphate is an organic compound and hydrotrope that provides [[energy]] to drive many processes in living cells, such as muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, condensate dissolution, and chemical synthesis.

- Formula C10H16N5O13P3

# Axon 
An [[Axon]] is a long, slender projection of nerve cells, or [[Neurons]], in vertebrates, that **typically conducts electrical impulses known as [[Action potentials]] away from the nerve cell body**. The function of the [[Axon]] is **to transmit information to different [[Neurons]], muscles, and glands**.

# Axon  hillock
Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock also has **the greatest density of [[Voltage-gated sodium channels]]**. This makes it the **most easily excited part of the neuron** and **the spike initiation zone for the axon**. In electrophysiological terms, **it has the most negative [[threshold potential]]**.



# Cell membrane
The **cell membrane** is a biological membrane **at separates the interior of all [[Cells]] from the outside environment (the extracellular space) and protects the cell from its environment**. The cell membrane **controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and organelles**, **being selectively permeable to [[Ions]] and organic molecules**. **In addition, cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes** such as cell adhesion, **ion conductivity and cell signalling**.

# Dendrites
Dendrites are branched protoplasmic extensions of a nerve cell **that propagate the electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells to the  [[Soma]], of the [[Neuron]]** from which the dendrites project. **Electrical stimulation is transmitted onto dendrites by upstream neurons** (usually via their [[Axons]]) **via [[Synapses]] which are located at various points throughout the dendritic tree**.


# Depolarization 
Fast change in the [[Resting potential]] to a more positive voltage.

# Electric potential
The [[Electric potential]] is **defined as the amount of work energy needed to move a unit of electric charge from a reference point to the specific point in an electric field**.

# Endoplasmic reticulum
The [[Endoplasmic reticulum]] **is, in essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell**, and has many other important functions **such as protein folding**.

# Facilitated transport 
Facilitated transport is **one way of moving those materials without expending [[cellular energy]]**. In facilitated transport, materials are moving down a [[concentration gradient]]. In other words, they are moving from an area of high concentration to low concentration, as in passive [[diffusion]].

# Golgi apparatus
The [[Golgi apparatus]] **packages proteins into membrane-bound vesicles inside the cell before the vesicles are sent to their destination**. It is of particular importance **in processing proteins, containing a set of glycosylation enzymes that attach various sugar monomers to proteins as the proteins move through the apparatus**.

# Hyperpolarization
Hyperpolarization is a change in a cell's [[Membrane potential]] that makes it more negative. It is the opposite of a [[Depolarization]]. It inhibits [[action potential]]s by increasing the stimulus required to move the membrane potential to the action potential threshold. 

# Ions
**[[Ions]] are atoms or molecules with a net electrical charge**. 

# Membrane potential
[[Membrane potential]] is **the difference in [[Electric potential]] between the interior and the exterior of a biological cell**. 

# Mitochondrion
Mitochondria **generate most of the [Cell] supply of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)**, subsequently utilized as **a source of chemical energy**, **using the energy of oxygen released in [[Aerobic respiration]] at the inner mitochondrial membrane**.

# Myelin sheath  
Myelin is a lipid-rich fatty substance **that sorrounds the nerve cell [[Axon]] to insulate them and increase the rate at which electrical impulses which are called [[Action potential]], are passed along the axon**.

# Nervous system
The [[Nervous system]] determines that it is a highly complex part of an animal **that coordinates its actions and sensory information by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body**. The nervous system **detects environmental changes that impact the body, then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events**.

# Neurons
**Neurons** or also called nerve cells are the **fundamental units of the brain** and [[Nervous system]], the cells responsible **for receiving Sensory input from the external world, for sending Motor commands to our muscles, and for transforming and relaying the Electrical signals ([[Action potential]]) at every step in between**. More than that, their interactions define **who we are as people**.

###  Shema of a neuron
![[anatomy-neurons-basic-types_english.jpg]]



# Neurotransmitters
A [[Neurotransmitter]] is a signaling molecule secreted by a neuron ([[Neurons]]) to affect another cell across a [[Synapse]]. The cell receiving the signal, any main body part, or target cell, may be another neuron, but could also be a gland or muscle cell.

#  Node of Ranvier
Nodes of Ranvier **occur along a myelinated [[Axon]] where the axolemma is exposed to the extracellular space**. Nodes of Ranvier are **uninsulated and highly enriched in [[Ion channels]], allowing them to participate in the exchange of [[Ions]] required to regenerate the [[Action potential]]**. Nerve conduction in myelinated axons is referred to as **[[Saltatory conduction]]** due to the manner in which the action potential seems to "jump" from one node to the next along the [[Axon]]. **This results in faster conduction of the action potential**. 

# Nucleous
**The cell [[Nucleous]] contains all of the cell's genome**

# Overshoot 
The region of the [[Action potential]] between the 0 mV level and the peak amplitude is the overshoot

# Receptor potential
A [[Receptor potential]] a type of graded potential, is the transmembrane potential difference produced by activation of a sensory receptor. A physical stimulus ([[Stimuli]]) acts on a sensory receptor.  That mechanical, chemical or light energy which acted as a stimulus is transformed into an electrical response this process is called sensory transduction. It is generally a depolarizing event resulting from inward current flow. The influx of current will often bring the membrane potential of the sensory receptor towards the threshold for triggering an [[Action potential]]. Receptor potential can work to trigger an action potential either within the same neuron ([[Neurons]]) or on an adjacent cell. 

## Different kinds of receptors
- Photorecptor 
- Chemorecptor
- Mechanoreceptor
- Thermoreceptor
- Electroreceptor 

# Repolarisation 
Return of the [[Membrane potential]] to the [[Resting potential]]

# Resting potential 
**[[Resting potential]] is the imbalance of electrical charge that exists between the interior of electrically excitable [[Neurons]] and their surroundings**. The resting potential of neurons lies typically in the range of **−70 to −80 millivolts**, with the inside of the cell **negatively charged**.  The resting potential **is maintained by the [[Sodium-potassium pump]], which steadily discharges more positive charge (Na+) from the cell than it allows in**, and by the **relatively high permeance of K+, which leaks out of the cell through its [[Membrane channels]] faster than Na+ leaks in**.

In a resting state mainly K+ ion channels are open in the axon membrane. 


If the inside of a cell becomes more electronegative (if the potential is made greater than the resting potential), the membrane or the cell is said to be **hyperpolarized** (**[[Hyperpolarization]]**). If the inside of the cell becomes less negative (the potential decreases below the resting potential), the process is called **[[Depolarization]]**

- In a resting state mainly K+ ion channels are open in the axon membrane.
- The intracellular space is charged negatively relative to the extracellular space.


# Saltatory conduction
Saltatory conduction i**s the propagation of Action potentials ([[Action potential]]) along myelinated axons ([[Myelin sheath]]) from one [[Node of Ranvier]] to the next node, increasing the conduction velocity of action potentials**. The uninsulated nodes of Ranvier are the only places along the [[Axon]] **where [[Ions]] are exchanged across the axon membrane ([[Cell membrane]]) , regenerating the action potential between regions of the axon that are insulated by myelin**, unlike electrical conduction in a simple circuit. 

# Sodium-potassium pump
The sodium-potassium pump is an active energy-consuming transport mechanism. Without it the ion concentrations would slowly even out and the [[Resting potential]] would reach zero. The pump is a membrane protein that in one cycle transports three Na+ ions out of the Cell and two K+ [[Ions]] into the Cell. The energy required for this process is delivered by [[ATP]] (Adenosine-triphosphate) which will be transformed into [[ADP]] (Adenosin-diphosphate) in the process.

# Soma
**The [[Soma]] is the body of the [[Neurons]]. As it contains the [[Nucleous]]**, most protein synthesis occurs here.

# Stimulus 
**A thing or event that evokes a specific functional reaction in an organ or tissue is called a [[Stimuli]]**.

#  Synapse 
In the [[Nervous system]], **a synapse is a structure that permits [[Neurons]] to pass an electrical or chemical signal to other neurons or to the target effector cell**. Transmissions across synapses are carried out by [[Neurotransmitters]]. Synapses connect one neuron with another one or with a gland or muscle cell.

## Composition
- [[synaptic knob]] 
- [[synaptic cleft]]
- **The cell and those parts in front of the synaptic cleft** are referred to as being **[[presynaptic]]**. 
- Those on the other side of the cleft are called **[[postsynaptic]]**

### Signal transmission at synapse 
- [[Synaptic vesicles]] found in the synaptic terminal store tiny amounts of neurotransmitters ([[acetylcholine]]). 
- Nerve signals traveling along an [[axon]] to reach an axon.
- [[Calcium ions]] entering the terminal an stimulating synaptic vesicles to merge with [[sending membrane]]. 
- Neurotransmitter molecules releasing into synaptic cleft and diffusing across the cleft to receiving membrane.
	- Neurotransmitter molecules bind with specific [[receptor proteins]].
- whether an [[action potential]] is triggered depends on on the type of neurotransmitter ([[excitatory]] or [[inhibitatory]]). 
	- Acetylcholine (ACh) is exciting --> [[sodium]] gates open and Na<sup>+</sup> diffuses into receiving [[neuron]]. 
- Inhibiting neurotransmitters cause [[potassium]] ions (K<sup>+</sup>) to enter the receiving neuron. Like [[GABA]] (gamma-Aminobutyric acid) or [[Glycin]]. 

#### EPSP and IPSP
 Excitatory postsynapric potential **([[EPSP]])**: 
 - [[Depolarization]] of the postsynaptic cell.
- Leads to an action potential if the threshold is reached. 

Inhibatory postsynaptic potential **([[IPSP]])**:
- [[Hyperpolarization]] in the postsynaptic cell. 
- Inhibits an action potential. 

##### Spacial summation and temporal summation
[[Spacial summation]]: 
- Several EPSP and IPSP [[axon hillock]] at the same time. 
	- More EPSP: --> action potential triggered 
	- More IPSP: --> no action potential triggered 

[[Temporal summation]]: 
- several EPSP and IPSP reach axon hillock over a certain time. 

# Synaptic knob
**Realeases [[Neurotransmitters]] to other [[Neurons]], [[Dendrites]], or tissues.**

# Volatage
Volatage is **the difference between two  [[Electric potential]]**.
