# The ATP-cycle
The cycle: 
- ADP + Energy + P --> [[ATP]] --> energy transfer reactions/metabolic reactions + H<sup>2</sup>O = [[ADP]]

## Production of ATP
[[Cellular respiration]]: 
-  [[Glucose]] enters the cell from the [[bloodstream]] via [[facilitated transport]]. 
- ATP is produced by the degradation of [[glucose]] (glycolisis) (2 ATP)
- [[Prep reaction]] produces [[substrate]] that catalyzes the citric acid cycle.
-  3 main steps of cellular respiration of which all produce ATP [[glycolisis]] (2 ATP), [[citric acid cycle]] (2 ATP) and [[electron transport chain]] (32-34 ATP).
-  From glycolisis and the citric acid cycle [[NADH]] carries electrons to the electron transport chain.
-  ATP exits the [[mitochondrion]] by facilitated transport. 
-  Importance of cellular respiration: Production of ATP = [[energy]] + emitting excess [[carbon dioxide]]. 

[[Enzymatic processes]] catalyse the reaction that yield ATP ([[chemical energy]]). The productivity of enzymes increases with temperature to a certain point ([[Van't Hoff rule]]).
