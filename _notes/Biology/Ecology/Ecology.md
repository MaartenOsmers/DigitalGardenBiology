# What is ecology
[[Ecology]] is the study of the relationships between living [[organisms]], including humans, and their physical [[environment]]; it seeks to understand the vital connections between [[plants]] and [[Animals]] and the world around them. Ecology also provides information about the benefits of [[ecosystems]] and how we can use Earthâ€™s [[resources]] in ways that leave the [[environment]] healthy for future generations.
