# Ecosystem
An [[Ecosystem]] consists of all the [[organisms]] and the physical [[environment]] with which they interact. These [[biotic factors]] and [[abiotic factors]] are linked together through [[nutrient cycles]] and [[energy flows]]. Energy enters the system through [[Photosynthesis]] and is incorporated into [[plant tissue]]. By feeding on [[plants]] and on one another, [[Animals]] play an important role in the movement of [[matter]] and [[energy]] through the system. They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial [[Biomass]] present. By breaking down dead organic matter, [[Decomposers]] release [[carbon]] back to the [[atmosphere]] and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and microbes.
