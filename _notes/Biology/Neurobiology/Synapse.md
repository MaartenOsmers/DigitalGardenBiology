#  Synapse 
In the [[Nervous system]], **a synapse is a structure that permits [[Neurons]] to pass an electrical or chemical signal to other neurons or to the target effector cell**. Transmissions across synapses are carried out by [[Neurotransmitters]]. Synapses connect one neuron with another one or with a gland or muscle cell.

## Composition
- [[synaptic knob]] 
- [[synaptic cleft]]
- **The cell and those parts in front of the synaptic cleft** are referred to as being **[[presynaptic]]**. 
- Those on the other side of the cleft are called **[[postsynaptic]]**

### Signal transmission at synapse 
- [[Synaptic vesicles]] found in the synaptic terminal store tiny amounts of neurotransmitters ([[acetylcholine]]). 
- Nerve signals traveling along an [[axon]] to reach an axon.
- [[Calcium ions]] entering the terminal an stimulating synaptic vesicles to merge with [[sending membrane]]. 
- Neurotransmitter molecules releasing into synaptic cleft and diffusing across the cleft to receiving membrane.
	- Neurotransmitter molecules bind with specific [[receptor proteins]].
- whether an [[action potential]] is triggered depends on on the type of neurotransmitter ([[excitatory]] or [[inhibitatory]]). 
	- Acetylcholine (ACh) is exciting --> [[sodium]] gates open and Na<sup>+</sup> diffuses into receiving [[neuron]]. 
- Inhibiting neurotransmitters cause [[potassium]] ions (K<sup>+</sup>) to enter the receiving neuron. Like [[GABA]] (gamma-Aminobutyric acid) or [[Glycin]]. 

#### EPSP and IPSP
 Excitatory postsynapric potential **([[EPSP]])**: 
 - [[Depolarization]] of the postsynaptic cell.
- Leads to an action potential if the threshold is reached. 

Inhibatory postsynaptic potential **([[IPSP]])**:
- [[Hyperpolarization]] in the postsynaptic cell. 
- Inhibits an action potential. 

##### Spacial summation and temporal summation
[[Spacial summation]]: 
- Several EPSP and IPSP [[axon hillock]] at the same time. 
	- More EPSP: --> action potential triggered 
	- More IPSP: --> no action potential triggered 

[[Temporal summation]]: 
- several EPSP and IPSP reach axon hillock over a certain time.
