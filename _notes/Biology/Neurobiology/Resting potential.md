# Resting potential 
**[[Resting potential]] is the imbalance of electrical charge that exists between the interior of electrically excitable [[Neurons]] and their surroundings**. The resting potential of neurons lies typically in the range of **−70 to −80 millivolts**, with the inside of the cell **negatively charged**.  The resting potential **is maintained by the [[Sodium-potassium pump]], which steadily discharges more positive charge (Na+) from the cell than it allows in**, and by the **relatively high permeance of K+, which leaks out of the cell through its [[Membrane channels]] faster than Na+ leaks in**.

In a resting state mainly K+ ion channels are open in the axon membrane. 


If the inside of a cell becomes more electronegative (if the potential is made greater than the resting potential), the membrane or the cell is said to be **hyperpolarized** (**[[Hyperpolarization]]**). If the inside of the cell becomes less negative (the potential decreases below the resting potential), the process is called **[[Depolarization]]**

- In a resting state mainly K+ ion channels are open in the axon membrane.
- The intracellular space is charged negatively relative to the extracellular space.
