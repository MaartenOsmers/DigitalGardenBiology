# Action potential
**An Action potential is a rapid rise and subsequent fall in voltage or membrane potential across a cellular membrane with a characteristic pattern**. **Sufficient current is required to initiate a voltage response in a cell membrane by passing the threshold**; if the current is insufficient to depolarize the membrane to the threshold level, **an action potential will not fire**. Examples of cells that signal via action potentials are **neurons and muscle cells**. -   Action potentials are caused **by [[Stimuli]] which are sufficient enough to pass the [[Threshold potential]] value of -50 to -55 mV**. It is important to know that the action potential behaves upon the **all-or-none law**. An **action potential propagates along the nerve fiber** **without decreasing or weakening of amplitude and length**. In addition, **after one action potential is generated, [[Neurons]] become refractory to stimuli for a certain period of time in which they cannot generate another Action potential**.

##  Steps of an action potential
An action potential has **four phases**: [[Resting potential]] **,[[Depolarization]]**, **[[Overshoot]]**, **[[Repolarization]]**. There is one more states of the membrane potential related to the action potential.**[[Hyperpolarization]]**, follows the **--> repolarization** and makes it more negatively charged It inhibits action potentials by increasing the stimulus required to move the membrane potential to the action potential threshold.  .

- The Resting potential is the initial state of an action potential (-70 mV)
- When an [[excitatory stimulus]] depolarizes the axon past its threshold (-55 mV), nearby [[Na+]] ion channels are opened. These channels are [[voltage-gated channels]]. A great Number of Na<sup>+</sup> ions enter the inside of the axon. This change in membrane potential leads to the opening of further [[voltage-gated sodium channels]] and [[Depolarization]] until the maximum for the action potential is reached (+35 mV). This phase of extreme positivity is the [[Overshoot]] phase. The individual Na<sup>+</sup> ion channels close fast and cannot be opened again for a short period of time until returning back to the resting potential. This process is called the [[refractory period]]. 
- The overshoot value **opens [[voltage-gated potassium channels]], which causes a large potassium efflux, decreasing the cell’s electropositivity**. This phase is the **repolarization** phase, whose purpose is to **restore the resting potential**. Repolarization always leads first to **hyperpolarization**.

### Refractory period
The refractory period **is the time after an [[Action potential]] is generated, during which the excitable cell cannot produce another action potential**. There are two subphases of this period, **absolute** and **relative refractoriness**.

#### Propagation of action potential
**An action potential is generated in the body of the neuron and propagated through its axon**. Propagation doesn’t decrease or affect the quality of the action potential in any way, so that the target tissue gets the **same impulse no matter how far they are from neuronal body**.

The action potential generates at one spot of the cell membrane. **It propagates along the membrane** with every next part of the membrane being sequentially depolarized. **This means that the action potential doesn’t move but rather causes a new action potential of the adjacent segment of the neuronal membrane**.

Action potential always propagates **forward**, **never backwards**. This is due to the refractoriness of the parts of the membrane **that were already depolarized**, **so that the only possible direction of propagation is forward**. Because of this, an action potential always propagates from the neuronal body, through the axon to the target tissue.

The speed of propagation largely depends on the thickness of the [[Axon]] and whether it’s myelinated or not. The larger the diameter, the higher the speed of propagation. The propagation is also faster if an axon is myelinated. Myelin ([[Myelin sheath]]) increases the propagation speed because it increases the thickness of the fiber. In addition, myelin enables [[Saltatory conduction]] of the action potential, since only the Ranvier nodes ([[Node of Ranvier]]) depolarize, and myelin nodes are jumped over.   
In unmyelinated fibers, every part of the axonal membrane needs to undergo [[Depolarization]], making the propagation significantly slower.
