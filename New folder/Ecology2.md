# What is ecology
[[Ecology]] is the study of the relationships between living [[organisms]], including humans, and their physical [[environment]]; it seeks to understand the vital connections between [[plants]] and [[Animals]] and the world around them. Ecology also provides information about the benefits of [[ecosystems]] and how we can use Earth’s [[resources]] in ways that leave the [[environment]] healthy for future generations.

# Abiotic factors
An [[abiotic factor]] is a non-living part of an [[Ecosystem]] that shapes its [[environment]]. In a terrestrial [[Ecosystem]], examples might include [[temperature]], [[light]], and [[water]]. In a [[marine ecosystem]], abiotic factors would include [[salinity]] and [[ocean currents]].

# Animals 
Are living [[organisms]] that feed on [[organic matter]], typically having specialized sense organs and [[Nervous system]] and able to respond rapidly to [[Stimuli]]. 

# Biocenosis
[[Biocenosis]] is an association of different [[organisms]] forming a closely integrated [[community]].

# Biomass
[[Biomass]] is the total  [[mass]] of all living [[organisms]].

# Biomass pyramid
A [[Biomass]] pyramid shows the flow of [[energy]] between various trophic levels ([[Trophic level]]) . [[Producers]] and [[Consumers]] make up the biomass pyramid, which displays all their comparative masses at the same time. To create the biomass pyramid, the approximate masses are stacked up according to a well-established hierarchy.

## Different kinds of biomass pyramids 
1. [[Biomass production pyramids]]: are similar to [[biomass pyramids]] with the difference that they illustrate [[biomass production]] over time. 
2. [[Number pyramids]]: Count the number of each individual in a trophic level. Number pyramids are sometimes inverted when the is for example a large tree. 
3. [[Energy pyramids]]: are similar to biomass pyramids since (dry) biomass tend to have similar energy contents. 

# Biosphere
The [[Biosphere]], also known as the ecosphere, is the worldwide sum of all [[ecosystems]]. It can also be termed the zone of life on Earth. The biosphere is virtually a closed system with regard to [[matter]], with minimal inputs and outputs.

# Biotic factor 
A [[biotic factor]] is the living component in an [[Ecosystem]]. Biotic factors are the living components, such as [[bacteria]], [[birds]], and any other living things present in an ecosystem.

# Biotope
A [[Biotope]] is an area of uniform environmental conditions providing a living place for a specific assemblage of [[plants]] and [[Animals]]

# Cellular Respiration
Cellular respiration, the process by which [[organisms]] combine [[oxygen]] with foodstuff molecules, diverting the [[chemical energy]] in these substances into life-sustaining activities and discarding, as waste products, c[[arbon dioxide]] and [[water]].

Equation: 
- C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6CO<sub>2</sub> --[[enzymes]]--> 38 [[ATP]] + heat + 6H<sub>2</sub>O

# Ecosystem
An [[Ecosystem]] consists of all the [[organisms]] and the physical [[environment]] with which they interact. These [[biotic factors]] and [[abiotic factors]] are linked together through [[nutrient cycles]] and [[energy flows]]. Energy enters the system through [[Photosynthesis]] and is incorporated into [[plant tissue]]. By feeding on [[plants]] and on one another, [[Animals]] play an important role in the movement of [[matter]] and [[energy]] through the system. They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial [[Biomass]] present. By breaking down dead organic matter, [[Decomposers]] release [[carbon]] back to the [[atmosphere]] and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and microbes. 
([[Biocenosis]]) + ([[Biotope]])

# Ecosystems
An [[Ecosystem]] is  geographic area where [[plants]], [[animals]], and other [[organisms]] as well as weather and landscape, work together to form a bubble of life. Ecosystems contain [[biotic factor]] or living, parts, as well as [[abiotic factor]], or nonliving parts.

# Energy flow in an ecosystem
[[Energy flow]] is the flow of [energy] through living things within an [[ecosystem]]. 

[[Gross primary production]] ([[GPP]]): 
- The total amount of [[organic material]] produced by [[primary producers]] ([[plants]]) (including that lost to [[respiration]])

[[Net primary production]] ([[NPP]]) :
- The amount of [[biomass]] that is available to [[consumers]] at each subsequent [[trophic level]]. (NPP= GPP - respiratory loses)

[[Secondary production]]: 
Secondary production represents the formation of living [[mass]] of a [[heterotrophic]] [[population]] or group of populations over some period of time.

# Enviromental factors
An [[Environmental factor]], ecological factor or eco factor is any, [[abiotic factor]] or [[biotic factor]], that influences living [[organisms]]. It can either benefit or harm an organism. 

Abiotic enviromental factors: 
- Physical or chemical in nature ([[light]], [[temperature]], [[salinity]], [[humidity]])

Biotic enviromental factors:
- Biological in nature (other [[living organisms]] such as [[predators]], [[competitors]] or [[prey]])

[[Ecological potency]] / [[Ecological tolerance]]: 
- The ecological potency/tolerance indicates in which range of values of environmental factors a species can thrive or survive in over a long period of time. 
	- Eurypotent: Eurypotent organisms are able to tolerate strong fluctuations in [[environmental factors]] such as [[temperature]], [[salinity]], [[pressure]], [[humidity]], [[radiation]] etc. 
	- Stenopotent: Stenopotent organism tolerate only minor fluctuations of an environmental factor. 

[[Tolerance curve]]: 
- [[Maximum]]: The maximum denotes the area where a life is just possible. [[Growth]] and [[reproduction]] are impaired or no longer possible.
- [[Minimum]]: The minimum indicates the area where a life is just possible. Growth and reproduction are impaired or no longer possible.
- [[Optimum]]: In the optimum of existence, living beings living there find the best [[conditions]]. Growth and reproduction reach their absolute highest value here.
- [[Pessimum]]: The pessimum refers to the limit value of a tolerance range of a biological species within which the respective organism can just still exist. The opposite of this is the optimum.
- [[Preference area]]: The preference is the area where all vital functions of an organism are perfectly intact. In which growth and long term survival is possible in this area. 

# Food chain / Food web
Food chain:
- A [[Food chain]] is a linear network of links in a [[food web]] starting from [[producer]] [[organisms]] and ending at an [[apex predator]] [[species]], [[detritivores]], or [[decomposer]] species. A food chain also shows how organisms are related to each other by the food they eat. Each level of a food chain represents a different [[Trophic level]].

Food web: 
- A f[ood web] is the natural interconnection of food chains and a graphical representation of what-eats-what in an ecological [[community]].

# Homeothermic
Are [[animals]] that maintain a stable internal [[body temperature ]] regardless of external influence ([[abiotic factors]] such as temperature). They achieve this by altering their [[metabolic rate]].

# Levels of ecological organisation

-  [[Organism]]: Individual living thing.
-  [[Population]]: Group of [[organisms]] of one type that live in  the same [[area]].
-  [[community]]: [[Populations]] that live together together in a defined [[area]].  
-  [[Ecosystem]]: [[community]] and its none living surroundings ([[abiotic factor]]).
-  [[Biosphere]]: [[Earth]] containing all its [[ecosystems]].

# Photosynthesis 
Photosynthesis is the process by which [[plants]] use sunlight ([[light]]) [[water]], and [[carbon dioxide]] to create [[oxygen]] and [[energy]] in the form of sugar.

Equation: 
- 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O --sunlight + [[cholorophyll]]--> 6O<sub>2</sub> + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>

Process: 
- Photosynthetic [[electron transport chain]] needs 12 water molecules and makes 6 oxygen molecules out of them.
- [[Calvin cycle]] needs 12 energy rich electrons by [[NADH]] or [[FADH2]],  a variable number of [[ATP]] molecules and 6 carbon dioxide molecules. And it produces 6 water molecules and one molecule of [[glucose]].

# Poikilothermic
An [[organism]] with a variable [[body temperature]] that tends to fluctuate with and is similar to or slightly higher than the temperature of its [[environment]]. 

# Population growth
Population growth refers to change in the size of a [[population]], which can be either positive or negative over time.

[[Birth rate]]:
- Number of births of a species over a given period of time. 

[[Mortality rate]]:
- Number of deaths of a species over a given period of time. 

[[Growth rate]]: 
- Growth rate = birth rate - mortality rate. 

[[Population size]]: 
- Number of individuals in the population.

[[Population density]]:
- Quantity of individuals of a population per unit of space. 

[[Limiting factors]]:
- Are limiting the population size and density. Limiting factors are [[biotic factors]] and [[abiotic factors]]. 

[[Density-independent limiting factors]]: Independent on the population density like [[climactic factors]]. 


[[Density-dependent limiting factors]]: dependent on the population density for example [[intraspecific competition]] for food and territory (between individuals of the same specif, hence intraspecific competition). Also the frequency of contagious diseases as well as the amount of [[predators]] that feed on given population is dependent on the population density. --> The denser the population the more predators seek it as [[prey]]. 

[[Exponential growth]]: 
- When the absolute number of [[offspring]] per period of time increases with [[population size]].(Only a theoretical concept does not apply in reality)

[[Logistic growth]]: 
- When resources are limited, populations exhibit logistic growth. In logistic growth, population expansion decreases as [[resources]] become scarce, leveling off when the [[carrying capacity of the environment]] is reached.

## Negative feedback in population growth
1. The larger a population is the lower the number of resources available. The lower the number of resources available the lower the birth rate. The lower the birthrate the smaller the population and its growth. 

2. The smaller the population the larger the number of resources available. The larger the number of resources available the higher the birthrate. The higher the birthrate the higher the population and its growth. 

### Competition 
In biology, competition refers to the rivalry between or among living things for [[territory]], [[resources]], [[goods]], [[mates]], etc.

I[[ntraspecific competition]]: 
- Competition within or among the same members of the same species. 

[[Interspecific competition]]: 
- Competition between the members of different [[species]]. 

[[Competitive exclusion]]: 
- Result of a competition in which species are forced out entirely or out of parts of their available [[habitat]], by a more efficient species.

[[Competitive exclusion principle]]: 
- The competitive exclusion principle, states that two species that compete for the exact same resources cannot stably [[coexist]]. 
	- Coexistence can occur if intraspecific competition is stronger then interspecific competition meaning that each species will inhibit their own population. 

#### Ecological niche
The [[ecological niche]] describes the functional position of an organism in its environment. It also considers habitat, activity patterns and its resources. 

[[Fundamental niche]]: 


[[Realised niche]]: 

# Production of matter in an ecosystem 

Autotroph: 
An [[autotroph]] or [[primary producer]] is an [[organism]] that produces complex organic compounds (such as [[carbohydrates]], [[fats]], and [[proteins]]) using [[carbon]] from simple substances such as [[carbon dioxide]]. [[Plants]] or [[algae]] are autotrophs. 

Heterotroph: 
A [[heterotroph]] is an [[organism]] that cannot produce its own food, instead taking [[nutrition]] from other sources of organic [[carbon]], mainly [[plant]] or [[animal]] matter. In the [[food chain]], heterotrophs are primary, secondary and tertiary consumers, but not [[producers]].

Material cycle: 
- [[Material cycles]] describe the flow of matter from the nonliving to the living world and back again. As this happens, [[matter]] can be stored, transformed into different molecules, transferred from [[organism]] to organism, and returned to its initial configuration.
- The carbon cycle: The first material cycle described in the video is the [[carbon cycle]], which is also a cycle for [[oxygen]]. The carbon cycle involves two chemical reactions that are also important in [[energy flow]]: [[photosynthesis]] and [[cell respiration]]. One reaction is the reverse of the other in terms of matter. Carbon enters the living world as [[carbon dioxide]] gas, which is “fixed” into [[sugar]] molecules. Carbon is recycled to the nonliving world as carbon dioxide gas; oxygen is recycled as oxygen gas. Oxygen from oxygen gas is never “fixed” in the way carbon is. It is used to “burn” sugar for [[energy]].

[[Dissimilation]]: 
- [[Degradation]] of organic substances with release of energy by cell respiration or [[fermentation]]. 

[[Phototrophic assimilation]]: 
- Conversion of foreign [[inorganic substances]] into [[endogenous organic substances]] mainly by photosynthesis. 
	- ([[Endogenous substances and processes]] are those that originate from within a system such as an organism, [[tissue]], or [[cell]].)

[[Heterothrophic assimilation]]:
- Conversion of foreign [[organic substances]] to endogenous organic substances by partial degradation of [[organic matter]] (dissimilation). 

- Endogenous organic matter = [[biomass]] 

# The ATP-cycle
The cycle: 
- ADP + Energy + P --> [[ATP]] --> energy transfer reactions/metabolic reactions + H<sup>2</sup>O = [[ADP]]

## Production of ATP
[[Cellular respiration]]: 
-  [[Glucose]] enters the cell from the [[bloodstream]] via [[facilitated transport]]. 
- ATP is produced by the degradation of [[glucose]] (glycolisis) (2 ATP)
- [[Prep reaction]] produces [[substrate]] that catalyzes the citric acid cycle.
-  3 main steps of cellular respiration of which all produce ATP [[glycolisis]] (2 ATP), [[citric acid cycle]] (2 ATP) and [[electron transport chain]] (32-34 ATP).
-  From glycolisis and the citric acid cycle [[NADH]] carries electrons to the electron transport chain.
-  ATP exits the [[mitochondrion]] by facilitated transport. 
-  Importance of cellular respiration: Production of ATP = [[energy]] + emitting excess [[carbon dioxide]]. 

[[Enzymatic processes]] catalyse the reaction that yield ATP ([[chemical energy]]). The productivity of enzymes increases with temperature to a certain point ([[Van't Hoff rule]]). 

# Trophic level
The trophic level is the position in a [[food chain]].

1. Trophic level: [[primary producers]] ([[plants]] and [[algae]]), ([[autotroph]])
2. Trophic level: [[primary consumers]] ([[animals]])
3. Trophic level: [[secondary consumers]] (animals), (intermediate [[predators]]) 
4. Trophic level: [[tertiary consumers]] (animals), ([[apex predators]])

## Ecological efficiency 
- [[Biomass]] production is reduced to 1/10 of the prior level with each subsequent trophic level.  Also called [[trophic efficiency]]. 


# Van't Hoff rule
The rule that the speed of [[chemical reactions]] is doubled, at least, for each 10°C rise in temperature.
