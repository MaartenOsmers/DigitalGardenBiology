# Material cycles in ecosystems


**Important concepts and terms:**
-  The concept of an ecosytem: functional structures, food chain and food web, general principle of material cycles and energy flow, the processes of the carbon cycle.

_Note: The knowledge about ecosystems shall be elaborated with the help of one example. Detailed knowledge on one special ecosystem is not required._ 

-   food web (food web and food chains) and energy flow (basic principles of energy flows, gross/net primary production)
-   Carbon cycles processes: inorganic or organically fixed carbon
-   Climate change: anthropogenic green house effect, human influences on the carbon cylce.


## The concept of an ecosytem


##### Key points:
-   **Producers**, or autotrophs, make their own organic molecules. **Consumers**, or heterotrophs, get organic molecules by eating other organisms.

-   A **food chain** is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass as one organism eats another.

-   In a food chain, each organism occupies a different **trophic level**, defined by how many energy transfers separate it from the basic input of the chain.

-   **Food webs** consist of many interconnected food chains and are more realistic representation of consumption relationships in ecosystems.

-   Energy transfer between trophic levels is inefficient—with a typical efficiency around 10%. This inefficiency limits the length of food chains.


**Levels of biological organization:** 
*<sub>Life is connected from the atomic level to the biosphere. The cell is the basic unit of life, and it comprises molecules and atoms. The sum of all life on planet earth is called biosphere.</sub>*

**Food chain:**
*<sub>A food chain is a linear network of the flow of energy, starting from producer organisms and ending at an apex predator species, detritivores, or decomposer species. </sub>*

- At the base of the food chain lie the **primary producers**. The primary producers are autotrophs and are most often photosynthetic organisms such as plants, algae, or cyanobacteria.

-   The organisms that eat the primary producers are called **primary consumers**. Primary consumers are usually **herbivores**, plant-eaters, though they may be algae eaters or bacteria eaters.

-   The organisms that eat the primary consumers are called **secondary consumers**. Secondary consumers are generally meat-eaters—**carnivores**.

-   The organisms that eat the secondary consumers are called **tertiary consumers**. These are carnivore-eating carnivores, like eagles or big fish.

-   Some food chains have additional levels, such as **quaternary consumers**—carnivores that eat tertiary consumers. Organisms at the very top of a food chain are called **apex consumers**.

**Food web:**
*<sub>Food chains give us a clear-cut picture of who eats whom. However, some problems come up when we try and use them to describe whole ecological communities. Thus a food web shows all of the food chains in an ecosystem.</sub>*

**Material and energy flow:** 
- Energy is transferred between trophic levels when one organism eats another and gets the energy-rich molecules from its prey's body. However, these transfers are inefficient, and this inefficiency limits the length of food chains.

- When energy enters a trophic level, some of it is stored as biomass, as part of organisms body. This is the energy that's available to the next trophic level since only energy stored as biomass can get eaten. Only about 10% of the energy that's stored as biomass in one trophic level ends up stored as biomass in the next trophic level. This is the **10% rule of energy transfer**.

**Components of an ecosystem:**
- Abiotic factors: 
  Are **nonliving conditions**, as climate (temperature, air, wind), radiation, water or chemicals (pH, salinity, minerals) that influences or affects an ecosystem and the organisms in it

- Biotic factors: 
  A biotic factor is **a living organism that shapes its environment**. In a freshwater ecosystem, examples might include aquatic plants, fish, amphibians, predatoes and algae.
