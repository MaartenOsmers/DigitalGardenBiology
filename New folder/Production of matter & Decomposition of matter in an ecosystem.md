# Production of matter & Decomposition of matter in an ecosystem 

**Important concepts and terms:**
-   production of energy-rich substances via photosynthesis in green plants
-   conversion of light energy into chemical energy in chemical substances
-   autotrophic and heterotrophic living beings
-   relationship between photosynthesis and cell respiration with focus on energy conversion and energy flow
-   balance equation of photosynthesis and cell respiration
-   degradation of energy-rich organic substances via cell respiration
-   Cell respiration as a production process for ATP

_Note: It is expected that you know about the general balance equation and the biological importance. The knowledge about chemical details, e.g. structural formulas is not expected. Basic knowledge of enzymology and cell structure however are required._


### Production of energy-rich substances via photosynthesis in green plants
- Photosynthesis is the production of energy-rich substances (mainly glucose = food) out of energy-poor substances (CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O) with the help of light.
- Green plants use a pigment called chlorophyll which can be fond in the chloroplast of plant cells to capture light energy.
- Plants provide food (glucose) and oxygen for the complex food webs on both land and in the oceans.

##  Autotrophic and heterotrophic living animals
- An autotroph:
  is **an organism that can produce its own food using light, water, carbon dioxide, or other chemicals**.
- A heterotroph:
is **an organism that eats other plants or animals for energy and nutrients**
